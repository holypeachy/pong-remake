# 🏓 Pong-Remake
#### I felt like I needed to make simpler games to really learn the fundamentals of the Unity Engine so I re-made the pong game. I had already worked on slightly more complicated projects with some friends but I always felt a bit shaky on actual development.
- Very basic graphics and gameplay
- I didn't know that the direction of the ball is determined by where it hits the paddle, so that's not a feature. Will add some time soon.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Unity 2021.3.11f1

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
git clone git@github.com:holypeachy/pong-remake.git
```
Run using Unity 2021
